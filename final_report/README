There are problems with the heatmap, which does not let me run Rmd and create an html file because of the size of the plot, so the final version will not have the heatmap and to see it, you need to run the script. Neither can I create a file with the heatmap. 

File unique is a bash script that is used to eliminate the repited genes from the annotation file, to run it just use bash unique.
