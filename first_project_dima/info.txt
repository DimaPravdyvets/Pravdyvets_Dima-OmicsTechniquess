!Series_summary	"Restoration of blood flow is the definitive therapy to salvage myocardium following ischemic injury. However, sudden restoration of blood flow to the ischemic myocardium causes ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI)."
!Series_summary	"Here, the cardioprotective effect of remote ischemic postconditioning (RPostC) was investigated, based on our in vitro rat model of myocardial IRI. Three groups, including Sham, IRI, and IRI+ RPostC, were utilized for the analysis of Affymetrix Rat Gene 2.0 ST chip."
!Series_overall_design	"Total RNAs were extracted and purified from the heart tissues of three groups using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies) and RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). Next, we synthesized the cDNA using an Ambion WT Expression Kit (Affymetrix), and obtained the cRNA by using a GeneChip WT Terminal Labeling and Controls Kit (Affymetrix, Inc.). Affymetrix Human Transcriptome Array 2.0 was then utilized to hybridize the fragmented cRNA product. After washing and staining in the GeneChip Fluidics Station 450, Affymetrix® GeneChip Command Console (AGCC) and robust multichip analysis (RMA) algorithms were used to scan the arrays and analyze the data"

!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch1	"Rats were randomly averaged into three groups, including Sham, IRI and IRI+RPostC. 1% sodium pentobarbital was used for the anaesthesia of rats. After the endotracheal intubation, a small animal ventilator assisted breathing was connected. We cut the skin longitudinally along the sternum, bluntly separated the muscles with hemostatic forceps, exposed the 3rd to 5th ribs on the left side of the sternum, and open the chest in the 4th intercostal space on the left side of the chest. We then cut the pericardium and fixed the thorax with a self-made hook to fully expose the heart section. The needle was inserted from the left atrial appendage and placed under the conus of the pulmonary artery. The anterior descending branch was ligated with a 6/0 medical suture for 30 minutes, then loosened, and the thoracic cavity was sutured layer by layer.  In the Sham group, the blood vessels of the anterior descending branch were not blocked after threading, and the chest was closed after 60 minutes of threading. In the IRI group, the left anterior descending coronary artery was blocked and opened 45 minutes later. After 15 minutes of stabilization, the chest was closed. In the IRI+RPostC group, after 45 minutes of anterior descending coronary artery occlusion, RPostC was performed. Method: The left femoral artery clamp was clamped for 30 seconds, opened for 30 seconds, repeated three times, and the chest was closed after 15 minutes of stabilization."
