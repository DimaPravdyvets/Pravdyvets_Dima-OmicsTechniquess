Sanger sequencing: 
There are three main steps to Sanger sequencing.

1. The first step is generating n DNA fragments of varying lengths, each terminated with a labeled nucleotide, where n is the number of nucleotide bases in the target DNA sequence. This is done by combining DNA primer, nucleotides (dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP), DNA polymerase, the DNA sequence of interest, and labeled dideoxynucleotides (ddATP, ddCTP, ddGTP, ddTTP). No nucleotide can be added to the DNA chain once a dideoxynucleotides has been incorporated, so each fragment will end with a labeled nucleotide. A much smaller amount of dideoxynucleotides is used than the amount of regular nucleotides.

2. The second step is to separate the n DNA sequences be length using capillary gel electrophoresis. The shorter fragments move faster than the longer fragments. The result is that the DNA pieces are fed into the third step from shortest to longest sequence.

3. In the third step a laser excites the label on the nucleotide at the end of each sequence. Each base is tagged with a different label, so the light emitted by each excited nucleotide can be tied to the correct base. The laser generates a chromatogram showing the fluorescent peak of each nucleotide. The chromatogram has the nucleotides in the correct order because of the electrophoresis.

NGS methods

Common characteristics of the methods:
1. Cell-free preparation of sequencing library
2. Solid-phase amplification
3. Massively paraller sequencing reaction of each DNA fragment independently
4. Direct sequencing without need of electrophoresis

454/Roche-Pyrosequencing
1.The process begins with a sample of double-stranded DNA.

2.The DNA is broken up into fragments of around 400 to 600 base pairs? using restriction enzymes ?that ‘cut’ the DNA at specific points.

3.Short sequences of DNA called adaptors?, are attached to the DNA fragments.

4.Tiny resin beads are added to the mix.

5.DNA sequences on the beads are complementary? to sequences on the adaptors, allowing the DNA fragments to bind directly to the beads, ideally one fragment to each bead.

6.When the DNA fragments attach to the DNA on the beads the bonds joining the double-strand together, break and the strands separate, becoming single-stranded DNA.

7.The fragments of DNA are then copied numerous times on each bead by a reaction known as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)?. This creates millions of identical copies of the DNA sequence.

8.The beads are then filtered to remove any that have either failed to attach to any DNA or contain more than one type of DNA fragment.

9.Then, the remaining beads are put into wells on a sequencing plate (one bead per well) along with enzyme beads that contain the DNA polymerase? and primer? needed for the sequencing reaction

10.The polymerase enzyme and primer attach to the DNA fragments on the beads.

11.Nucleotide bases? are added to the wells in waves of one type of base at a time: a wave of As, followed by a wave of Cs, followed by Gs, followed by Ts.

12.When each base is incorporated into the DNA, light is given out and this is recorded by a camera.

13.The intensity of the light corresponds to the number of nucleotides of the same type that have been incorporated. For example, if there are three consecutive As in the fragment, the amount of light generated would be three times that of a single A in the fragment.

14.By plotting this pattern of light intensity on a graph, the sequence of the original piece of DNA can be decoded.

Illumina - reversible terminations

1.The first step in this sequencing technique is to break up the DNA ?into more manageable fragments of around 200 to 600 base pairs?.

2.Short sequences of DNA called adaptors?, are attached to the DNA fragments.

3.The DNA fragments attached to adaptors are then made single stranded. This is done by incubating the fragments with sodium hydroxide.

4.Once prepared, the DNA fragments are washed across the flowcell. The complementary DNA binds to primers? on the surface of the flowcell and DNA that doesn’t attach is washed away.

5.The DNA attached to the flowcell is then replicated to form small clusters of DNA with the same sequence. When sequenced, each cluster of DNA molecules will emit a signal that is strong enough to be detected by a camera.

6.Unlabelled nucleotide bases? and DNA polymerase? are then added to lengthen and join the strands of DNA attached to the flowcell. This creates ‘bridges’ of double-stranded DNA between the primers on the flowcell surface.

7.The double-stranded DNA is then broken down into single-stranded DNA using heat, leaving several million dense clusters of identical DNA sequences.

8.Primers and fluorescently?-labelled terminators (terminators are a version of nucleotide base – A, C, G or T - that stop DNA synthesis) are added to the flowcell.

9.The primer attaches to the DNA being sequenced.

10.The DNA polymerase then binds to the primer and adds the first fluorescently-labelled terminator to the new DNA strand. Once a base has been added no more bases can be added to the strand of DNA until the terminator base is cut from the DNA.

11.Lasers are passed over the flowcell to activate the fluorescent label on the nucleotide base. This fluorescence is detected by a camera and recorded on a computer. Each of the terminator bases (A, C, G and T) give off a different colour.

12.The fluorescently-labelled terminator group is then removed from the first base and the next fluorescently-labelled terminator base can be added alongside. And so the process continues until millions of clusters have been sequenced.

13.The DNA sequence is analysed base-by-base during Illumina sequencing, making it a highly accurate method. The sequence generated can then be aligned to a reference sequence, this looks for matches or changes in the sequenced DNA.

DNA-seq applications:

1.De-novo genome sequencing
Assembly of genomes after reads are obtained, done with contigs->scaffolds may lead to errors while recreating a genome

2.Complete genome sequencing
Next step after de-novo reassembly where sequenced genomes are rectreated using another already recreated genome as a reference

3.Reduced representation sequencing
DNA microarrays, Affymetrix oligonucleotide arrays, sequencing used to obtain some representation of a genome, but not as specific as target genome sequencing


4.Target genome resequencing
Basically a study of smaller parts of DNA to search for specific things like tumor genes, variant discovery, only exons, etc. 

5.Paired-end sequencing
Contruct a genomic library of a specific size -> sequence this fragments from the ends (paired-end) -> Map paired-ends to a reference genome. Good for identifyind genome modifications: deletions, insertions, etc 

6.Metagenomics sequencing
Sequencing of genomes from mixed environmental samples like water where more than 1 organism and spicie are present. Can be useful for researches in environemnt. 

7.Molecular barcoding
Putting a barcode on a read via primers, can be useful to identify specific DNA fragments from different samples or organisms, study repetitive regions and the sequencing is is really long (>10mb).

The trascriptome - all the transcripts of a cell and their quantities in a specific stage of development and a given condition

Aims of transcriptome - catalog all types of trascripts; determine transcriptional structure of genes like transcription start sites, UTR, splicing patterns, etc; quantify changes in the levels of expression of each transcript in different moments of a cell.

Why RNA study is so important:
-Genes and other expressed sequences of a genome 
-Gene regulation and regulatory sequences 
-Function of genes and their interaction
-Functional differences between tissues and cell types
-Identification of candidate genes for any specific process or disease 

There are two types of experimental methods to analyze the transcriptome are: one single gene, whole transcriptome 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
\\\\\
ESTs - Sequencing cDNA libraries 
(Expressed sequence tags)
Obtain cDNA  from reverse transcriptome. create a library out of it, align it to the genome, this alignment will show which are parts specific for genes and other transcribed regions.
This tecnique can be used for gene annotation

Limitations: 
-low throughput
-Elevated cost
-Quantification is not accurate
-Different isoforms are generally inistinguishable
\\\\\
Microarrays
-Multiple DNA probes fixed on a glass slide
-Hybridization of fluorescently-laballed RNA
This tecnique is used for gene expression arrays, genome tiling arrays, basically showing expression of genes or searching for new transcripts
Limitations:
-Lack of reproducibility and standarization
-Small dynamic range and saturation
-Relative measures
-Little information 
-Inability to detect unknown sequences 
and for genome tiling arrays also an Elevated cost
\\\\\
RNA-seq - new approach for transcriptome profiling that uses deep-sequenccing tecnologies, provides far more precise measurement of levels of transcripts and isoforms than other methods.

Basically whole RNA sequencing using NGS tecnologies:
-Identification of transcribed sequences
-Quantification of transcript abundance
-Multiple reads along each RNA
-Analysis of alternative transcript isoforms

RNA is mapped into exon-exon junctions, meaning that read sare split by an intron when aligned to a genome of interes
Advantages of RNA seq are:
-It is not necessary to know the genomic sequence of transcribed
regions in advance
- It allows detecting novel transcripts
- High precision in the detection of the limits of the transcripts
- It allows detecting all splicing variants and alternative start and end sites of distinct transcripts
- It allows detecting SNPs in transcribed regions
- It allows detecting the specific transcription profiles of each allele
- Quantification of the levels of expression of each transcript is accurate (long dynamic range)
- Very reproducible
- Requires small amount of initial RNA

Transcipts can later be reconstructed by align assembling or de novo assembling, different reconstruction methods can give different type of information 

Also gene expression quantification is a thing which is reported in amount of reads per kb of exonic bases, this can identify differential expression for individual isoforms between conditons

Typical workflow:
1. Map reads to a reference genome Tophat
2. Assemble reads into transcripts Cufflinks
3. Reconcile transcripts across multiple samples Cuffmerge
4. Quantify isoform expression Cuffdiff
5. Visualization IGV

Transcriptional landscape of a genome 

A protein coding gene can be undergo different splicing which may lead to different outcomes of transcription. This differences in splicicng can be studied by tecniques mentioned before. There is also regulation of this alternative splicing, it can undergo different regulators.

Also non-coding RNA exists.
